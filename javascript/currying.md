# Currying
- Currying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple
arguments into a sequence of functions that each accept a single argument.
The idea is to allow a function to gradually receive the arguments required
for it to carry out its ultimate task.
- A Curried function is essentially a series of functions each accepting
 a single argument and, in turn, returning a function until it has received
 everything it requires. At that point, it returns an actual value.
- Currying is present in functional programming languages where the
output of a function is reliant solely upon its arguments as opposed to
some local or global state.
