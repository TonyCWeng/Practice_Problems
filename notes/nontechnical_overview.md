# MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- Design pattern (Ex. Rails)

- Model (information retrieval, edits/logic performed on)
- View (what the user interacts/sees)
- Controller (interface between model and view)

## REST
- Standardized operations (GET, POST, PATCH, EDIT, DELETE) yields predictable result.
- Server does not retain session info over multiple requests (data can be cached, however)

## Rake
- Carries out administrative tasks (display routes, migrate/seed database)

## JSX
- JS extension syntax, allows for use of HTML tags inside of JavaScript. Hence its use in React components.
