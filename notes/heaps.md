# Heaps
- BST with constraints (Completeness and Heap Property).
- Completeness (nodes are added from top to bottom, left to right)
 * Empty tree is also considered complete.
- Heap Property: key stored in each node is either >= or <= keys in children
  nodes. When the parent is >= to its children, it is called a max-heap.
  When the parent node is <= its children, the heap is called a min-heap.

- Insertion: average O(1), worse-case O(log n)
