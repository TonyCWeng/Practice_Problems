Memoization
- Optimization technique through caching previously computed results.
- Used when you wish to revisit computed values.
- Differs from dynamic programming, which is a technique for solving problems
recursively when the computations may overlap within subproblems?

* One could say that memoization is a method of implementing dynamic programming.
* The other method would be tabulation which is an iterative approach.
- We split the problem into sub problems and solve those portions.
- Main method calls on sub problems.
