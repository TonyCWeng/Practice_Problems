## Jagged Array (C#)
- An array of arrays. Not really related to everything else.

## Polymorphism (two forms: compile-time and runtime)
- means one to many. Usually in reference to an object belonging to more than one class.
- Ex. Animal class can have a subclass of Cat. If we had an instance of a Cat called Max, it would belong to both the Cat Class and the Animal superclass.
  - Strictly speaking, any Java object is polymorphic in nature in the sense that it would pass the IS-A test for itself and for the Object class. But it's a bit pedantic.
